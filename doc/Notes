npm prune: If you have a package in node_modules that you don't need but you forgot to uninstall, you can run:
npm prune
This will remove extraneous packages â€” i.e., packages that are listed in node_modules but are not in your package.json file. This typically happens when you manually delete or modify node_modules without updating package.json.

npm-check: You can use third-party tools like npm-check to help you find and remove unused dependencies.
To install npm-check:
npm install -g npm-check
Then run it:
npm-check

This will show you a list of dependencies and allow you to interactively choose which ones you want to keep or remove.
depcheck: Another popular tool is depcheck, which analyzes your project and reports unused dependencies. It's useful for identifying packages that are listed in package.json but never actually used in your code.
To install depcheck:
npm install -g depcheck
Then run it in your project directory:
depcheck
It will provide a list of unused dependencies that you can remove.
